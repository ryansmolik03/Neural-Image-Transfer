# Neural-Style-Transfer

* Playing around with a neural network from TensorFlow's [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer) on Neural Style Transfer. 
* Most of the code is from the tutorial, but I adapted the tutorial to be used for other images seen in the Jupyter Notebook. 
* The example below show an [image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGi31SlH7pf/) of the Jaeger Center originally from the Gettysburg College Instagram Page. The style from three famous pieces of art were transferred to this image.
  - Van Gogh's [*Starry Night*](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-starry-night/bgEuwDxel93-Pg?hl=en)
  - Kadinsky's [*Composition VII*](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/composition-vii/CQHOKgpWcL_UPA?hl=en)
  - Monet's [*Impression, Sunrise*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression,_Sunrise)
